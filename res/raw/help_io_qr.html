<h1>Hardware in v1.7</h1>
<h2>Discovering and controlling hardware</h2>
Previously, hardware was controlled by writing data to hard-coded memory addresses.<br/><br/>
However, with the new 1.7 specification, the HWN, HWQ and HWI instructions are used to query, enumerate and control hardware via hardware interrupts.<br/><br/>
<br/>
The HWN instruction sets its parameter to the number of connected hardware devices.<br/><br/>
Typical programs will then iterate over the connected devices, obtaining info about them with the HWQ instruction.<br/><br/>
This instruction's parameter indicates the device whose information to obtain.  The information is then written to the A, B, C, X and Y registers.<br/><br/>
A and B receive the hardware ID.<br/><br/>
C receives the hardware version number.<br/><br/>
X and Y receive the manufacturer's ID.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, the HWI instruction sends an interrupt message to a given hardware device indicated by its parameter.<br/><br/>
Any parameters for the interrupt must be set in the correct registers prior to using HWI.<br/><br/>
For example, most hardware (so far) reads from the A register to determine the type of interrupt being sent, and the B and C registers are commonly used to hold extra information.<br/><br/>
The exact meaning of each of the registers depends on the hardware device to which the interrupt is sent.  See below for currently-supported devices.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Putting this all together, the following example finds the number of devices, searches (backwards) for the LEM1802 display device, and calls an interrupt on it:<br/><br/>
<br/>
; Get hardware count<br/>
HWN J<br/>
<br/>
:loop<br/>
; Check we have some hardware<br/>
IFE J, 0<br/>
SET PC, end<br/>
<br/>
; Device numbers start from 0, so subtract 1 from J now<br/>
SUB 1, J<br/>
; Query device J<br/>
HWQ J<br/>
<br/>
; Check if device info matches LEM1802
IFN A, 0xF615<br/>
SET PC, loop<br/>
IFE B, 0x7349<br/>
SET PC, loop<br/>
IFE C, 0x1802<br/>
SET PC, loop<br/>
IFE X, 0x8B36<br/>
SET PC, loop<br/>
IFE Y, 0x1C6C<br/>
SET PC, loop<br/>
<br/>
; Reaching this point means the device matches<br/>
; Set up registers for the interrupt, then send it<br/>
SET A, 0x0<br/>
SET B, 0x8000<br/>
HWI J<br/>
<br/>
SET PC, loop
:end
<br/>

<h1>Appendix - old v1.1 I/O Quick Reference</h1>
Currently, I/O consists of writing to the console (somewhat standardised), keyboard input (somewhat standard), and interfacing with the ship (non-standard).

<h2>Console</h2>
Write to 0x8000 - 0x81FF for 7-bit ASCII output to 32x16 screen. <br/><br/>
Format (16 bits): ffffbbbbcaaaaaaa <br/><br/>
ffff is 4-bit foreground colour <br/><br/>
bbbb is 4-bit background colour <br/><br/>
c is the blink bit (not implemented) <br/><br/>
aaaaaaa is the 7-bit ASCII value <br/><br/>
<br/>
Colours are 4-bit values of format: hrgb <br/><br/>
h is highlight on/off (use brighter colours or not)<br/><br/>
r is red component <br/><br/>
g is green component <br/><br/>
b is blue component <br/><br/>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
Keyboard input is written to a cyclic 16-word buffer, from 0x9000 to 0x900f. <br/><br/>
The value written is the Unicode value of the key pressed, truncated to 16 bits. <br/><br/>
Input is only written if the next space is free, so set key codes to 0 after reading them. <br/><br/>
Most recent key location is written to 0x9010. <br/><br/> 


<h2>Harcoded memory addresses</h2>
These are subject to change at any time. <br/><br/>
0xAD00 - Throttle control <br/><br/>
0xAD01 - (reserved for pitch) <br/><br/>
0xAD02 - Yaw <br/><br/>
0xAD03 - (reserved for roll) <br/><br/>
0xAD04 - (reserved for pitch gyro) <br/><br/> 
0xAD05 - Yaw gyro <br/><br/>
0xAD06 - (reserved for roll gyro) <br/><br/><br/>

0xAD10 - Radar control. Set to 0xFFFF to get count, set to index number (starting at 1) for that contact's info. <br/><br/>
0xAD11 - Radar contact count <br/><br/>
0xAD12 - Current contact X <br/><br/>
0xAD13 - (reserved for contact Y) <br/><br/>
0xAD14 - Current contact Z <br/><br/>
0xAD15 - (reserved for contact type) <br/><br/>
0xAD16 - (reserved for contact size) <br/><br/>
0xAD17 - (reserved for contact IFF code) <br/><br/>
