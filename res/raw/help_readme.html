Installation<br/>
------------<br/>
Easiest method: Download from Google Play - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sticksoft.adce">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sticksoft.adce</a><br/>
To install directly to an Android phone, download the raw .APK file in your phone's browser.  Open the file, and you should be prompted to install it.<br/>
Note: You may need to allow applications from unknown sources on your phone.  Simply go to Settings -> Applications and check the "Unknown sources" box.<br/>
<br/>
Usage<br/>
-----<br/>
The first tab shown on app startup is the Control tab, containing the RAM viewer (box at the top) and controls for starting / resetting the emulator.<br/>
This won't do much until you assemble a program!<br/>
<br/>
The second tab is the Assembly view.  Here, you can load / save an assembly file from disk (press the Menu key for options) and assemble a program.<br/>
Pressing "Assemble" will reset the emulator, assemble your program, output the assembled binary and an assembly -> binary view for debugging, and load the binary data into the emulator's memory.<br/>
Return to the first tab to start it and view changes to the memory.<br/>
<br/>
The third tab displays the text console.  This is a work-in-progress and, as such, colours may not be displayed the same as other emulators.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth tab displays a virtual ship!  Control it by writing to 0xAD00 (throttle) and 0xAD02 (yaw starboard / port); sample code is included that does this (move.dasm).<br/>
Values for these registers are interpreted as signed 2's complement integers; e.g. 0x7FFF = all ahead full, 0x8000 = full reverse, 0x0000 = all stop.<br/>
<br/>
For current rotation speed, read from 0xAD05 - positive (&lt; 0x8000) values are clockwise (starboard) and negative values are anticlockwise.<br/>
<br/>
Harcoded memory addresses<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
These are subject to change at any time.<br/>
0xAD00 - Throttle control<br/>
0xAD01 - (reserved for pitch)<br/>
0xAD02 - Yaw<br/>
0xAD03 - (reserved for roll)<br/>
0xAD04 - (reserved for pitch gyro) <br/>
0xAD05 - Yaw gyro<br/>
0xAD06 - (reserved for roll gyro)<br/>
<br/>
0xAD10 - Radar control. Set to 0xFFFF to get count, set to index number (starting at 1) for that contact's info.<br/>
0xAD11 - Radar contact count<br/>
0xAD12 - Current contact X<br/>
0xAD13 - (reserved for contact Y)<br/>
0xAD14 - Current contact Z<br/>
0xAD15 - (reserved for contact type)<br/>
0xAD16 - (reserved for contact size)<br/>
0xAD17 - (reserved for contact IFF code)<br/>
<br/>
Known Issues<br/>
------------<br/>
Should auto-assemble and reset on startup (doesn't yet)<br/>
The asteroids are offset slightly on the radar<br/>
