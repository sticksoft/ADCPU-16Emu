README
======

Overview
--------
This version successfully assembles and runs the example found at http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt.
Supported features include emulator, assembler, console output and virtual ship (2D).

Installation
------------
Easiest method: Download from Google Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sticksoft.adce
To install directly to an Android phone, download the raw .APK file in your phone's browser.  Open the file, and you should be prompted to install it.
Note: You may need to allow applications from unknown sources on your phone.  Simply go to Settings -> Applications and check the "Unknown sources" box.

Usage
-----
The first tab shown on app startup is the Control tab, containing the RAM viewer (box at the top) and controls for starting / resetting the emulator.
This won't do much until you assemble a program!

The second tab is the Assembly view.  Here, you can load / save an assembly file from disk (press the Menu key for options) and assemble a program.
Pressing "Assemble" will reset the emulator, assemble your program, output the assembled binary and an assembly -> binary view for debugging, and load the binary data into the emulator's memory.
Return to the first tab to start it and view changes to the memory.

The third tab displays the text console.  This is a work-in-progress and, as such, colours may not be displayed the same as other emulators.
Keyboard input has not yet been implemented for the console (I'm tidying up and adding other features at the moment) - drop me a line at @sticksoft on Twitter if you're desparate for it!

The fourth tab displays a virtual ship!  Control it by writing to AD00 (throttle) and AD02 (yaw starboard / port); sample code is included that does this (move.dasm).
Values for these registers are interpreted as signed 2's complement integers; e.g. 0x7fff = all ahead full, 0x8000 = full reverse, 0x0000 = all stop.  

Known Issues
------------
Doesn't ask for confirmation before saving over files :( Keep backups!
No keyboard input yet
Should auto-assemble and reset on startup (doesn't yet)
